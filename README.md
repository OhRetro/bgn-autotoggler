# Background NPCs - Auto Toggler

Tired of changing BGN (Background NPCs)'s settings depending on what map you are on?  
let's say you are at gm_bigcity and your PC is not good enough to run with the default 35 max npcs and everytime you go to this map you always have to change the settings.  
let's say you are in a small map and you don't want to have NPCs on the map, and so you disable in the settings, but when you change to a map where you want to play with the NPCs, you have to change the settings manually
